# Dev Container Features

> This repository contains custom dev container features that enhance my development workflow. The features are located in the `src` directory and include tools and configurations that I frequently use.

## Features

### Google Cloud SDK

The `google-cloud-sdk` feature installs the Google Cloud SDK and optional additional components.

**NOTE:** Ubuntu 24.04 is currently **not** supported by this feature due to an issue with the `apt` package manager. The issue is being tracked [here]() and will be resolved once a fix is available.

### ngrok

The `ngrok` feature installs the ngrok binary; a globally distributed reverse proxy that secures, protects and accelerates your applications and network services, no matter where you run them.
