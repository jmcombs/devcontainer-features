# Dev Container Features

> This repository contains custom dev container features that enhance my development workflow. The features are located in the `src` directory and include tools and configurations that I frequently use.

## Features

### Google Cloud SDK

The `google-cloud-sdk` feature installs the Google Cloud SDK and optional additional components.

**NOTE:** If using Ubuntu 24.04 on `arm64` [Google Cloud SDK Issue 383568269](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/383568269) is currently being worked on to resolve the issue. Until resolved, version 502.0.0-0 will be installed.

### ngrok

The `ngrok` feature installs the ngrok binary; a globally distributed reverse proxy that secures, protects and accelerates your applications and network services, no matter where you run them.
